# Rainbow Six Siege

### Where It Started
I used to play the video game Rainbow Six Siege for about 5 years before I decided to call it quits. Rainbow Six Siege came out in late 2015 and I was one of the few people to pickup the beta and start to play it. I played on Xbox when it was very popular and I played it when it wasn't very popular. I went from playing on weekend tournaments and leagues to not even owning an xbox anymore(switched to PC).

### Where It Ended
I had a group of three friends, including me, who played almost everyday for about a year at the highest level in the game. That was the start of the downfall and how the game became very boring.
